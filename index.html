        <h3>Luna History</h3>
        <p>My name is Luna and I am a German Sheperd mix. I was born in the Bakersfield/Fresno area but then my sister
          and I were
          brought up to the Bay Area and stayed at the Family Dog Rescue Shelter. We were there a couple of weeks before
          we
          were let out to meet people.</p>
        <p>
          Within the first week of being able to see people, a nice family of three young people came in and picked
          myself
          and my sister as pets they thought they might want. We were still tired from our traveling so we did not do
          much, but the family liked how mellow we were. They wanted to take my sister and I together but the shelter
          would
          not let them take both of us.

        </p>
        <p>
          So, off I went, with my new family. Now I am almost one year old and I am having a great time. I love being
          outside,
          running around, playing fetch, biting whatever I can get my teeth on and getting my belly rubbed.
        </p>
