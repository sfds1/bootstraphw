# Luna Homepage - Homework #2 - Using Bootstrap

## Description 

Now editing the html pages using Bootstrap. This seems like it should be easier than coding it with HTML and CSS alone as many things are already "set" with Bootstrap.  There is still a lot of things that need to be researhed though as there are a LOT of things Bootstrap can do.

In the end I feel like I spent as much time on this assignment as the last as I had to do a lot of searching for the Boostrap commands to do what I wanted the pages to do.  I think once someone knows most of the commands then using Boostrap will be easier and faster to create web applications.

I definitley learned a lot from this project and am looking forward to learning more.
